  <p style="color":blue;font-size:40px font-weight:bold > Earth is the planet we live on. It is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. Lots of scientists think the earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago.[5] It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus and Mars.</style></p>

<div>The large mass of the sun makes Earth move around it, just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the sun at different times. Earth goes around the sun once (one "year") for every 365¼ times it turns around (one "day")</style></div>

<div>Earth is the only planet in our solar system that has a large amount of liquid water.[6] About 74% of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this, people sometimes call it "blue planet".[7]</div>

<div>Because of its water, Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals.[8][9] The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of Earth's surface is called the "biosphere"</div>
<div>Earth is part of the eight planets and many thousands of small bodies that move around the Sun as its solar system. The Solar System is moving through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy now, and will be for about the next 10,000 years.[11]

Earth is about 150,000,000 kilometers or 93,000,000 miles away from the sun (this distance is called an "Astronomical Unit"). Earth moves on its orbit at an average speed of about 30 km or 19 mi a second.[12] Earth turns all the way around about 365¼ times in the time it takes for Earth to go all the way around the sun.[13] To make up this extra bit of a day every year, an additional day is used every four years. This is named a "leap year".

The Moon goes around Earth at an average distance of 400,000 kilometers (250,000 mi). It is locked to Earth, so that it always has the same half facing Earth; the other half is called the "dark side of the moon". It takes about 27⅓ days for the Moon to go all the way around Earth, but because Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time, it takes about 29½ days for the Moon to go from dark to bright to dark again. This is where the word "month" came from, even though most months now have 30 or 31 days. <div>
